kit is yet another keyword-based manager for small command line tools under unix-like operating system. 

# Usage
For instance, *idx* is a bash script under *csv* directory to add number index for each column in csv file.

- Run command where run is optional
kit [run] csv idx

- Edit command
kit edit csv idx

All the scripts are organized in the *scripts* directory, and you can check out all the small tools or add your own. 

# Completion for Bash

The kit_bash_completion under *contrib* directory adds completion support for bash.
